# growthrateR
Shiny app for estimating growth rates from OD data

Code and functions used in my shiny app, <a href="https://vedomics.shinyapps.io/growthrateR/?_ga=2.57990767.435307508.1613752576-912579947.1611334819"> growthrateR </a>

<strong> FYI: </strong> Takes OD data from a plate reader as a .csv file with wells as headers and time as a column and estimates growth-rates in a user-dependent fashion. Users can then download their files.
